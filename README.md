MetaboLM: A metabolomic language model for multi-disease early prediction and risk stratification
=====
MetaboLM is a transformer-based language model that was pre-trained on plasma metabolomics data from 83,744 healthy UK Biobank participants, enabling it to capture inherent patterns of metabolite interactions. We fine-tuned the model using metabolomics data from individuals diagnosed with 16 common chronic diseases. Additionally, MetaboLM can be adapted to support other custom fine-tuning tasks. We have provided the main code for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating discriminative performance, while the remaining plotting code will be made publicly available after the article is published.
